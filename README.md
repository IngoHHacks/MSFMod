## Modded Save Fixer ##
Fixes invalid abilities stored in the save file.<br>
An auxiliary file is created to store the names of modded abilites. This file is used to resolve the inconsitencies between ability ids when installing or removing mods.<br>
More save-fixing features, such as cards/consumables and mid-run mod-changing error fixing will be added in the future.
